# ACV_Colorization: Koalarization
This Branch contains the implementation of Deep Koalarization Image Colorization Model. This model is an Encoder Decoder model with a Feature Extractor generated by a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model. Below is an image of the model:

Our model differs from the published implementations of Deep Koalarization as we use 32x32 scaling for the images passed through the main Encoder Decoder block of the model to help speed up training. Saffolding is provided to use data from non-32x32 datasets.

In order to run the code, select the dataset you want to use under the data category (CIFR10 is recommended; scaffolding is included if you'd like to use FLICKR30) and then run all subsequent code blocks listed under "Model" to set up the model's Encoder Decoder structure plus prepare the pretarined Inception-ResNet-v2 feature extractor. Visualization blocks are provided to graph the training/val loss plus visualize the output and target images. Along with visualization, code is included to evaluate the accuracy of the output image colorization via DeltaE 76, which is printed when visualizing images. Please change file paths wherever needed to indicate where you want to save your model to and load your model from.
